Team name: Halo Clone

Team members: Connor Boerma, Lucas Devries, Dylan Kuipers, Adam Prins

# Introduction

Our project will be a Unity-based arena FPS game. This game will try to mimic the general feel of arena shooters like Halo. Our goal is to have a sandbox where players can use a variety of weapons to kill each other.

Our major goals include multiple weapons that players will be able to pick up and use in the arena itself. We hope to add team-based objectives such as a Team Deathmatch mode. Should there be time available, we also would like to try and add vehicles to the maps, but this is a very low priority at this point in time.

# Anticipated Technologies

- Unity Game Engine
- Git
- ZeroTier

# Method/Approach

We will have two teams working together to accomplish this project. One team will work on adding new features into a single-player environment. The second team will take new features the first team makes and add them to the multiplayer framework. We will repeat this process for each feature that we want in our game and eventually will be left with our final project.

# Estimated Timeline

- Asset Collection - February 19th

# Anticipated Problems

- Incorporating multiplayer
